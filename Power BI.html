Data Source: This Dataset was provided by Quantum Analytics NG. <br> <br>

Key Metrics: <br>
* Gross Revenue : $20M <br>
* City : 4119 <br>
* Orders : 118k <br>
* Total Sales Persons : 3096 <br>
* Total Customers : 99k <br>
* State : 26 <br> <br>

<center><b>Key Insights: </b> <br> <br></center>


*The total Gross Revenue is 20M from 118K orders across 26 states with 99K customers. <br>
*3096 sellers are contributing to this revenue. <br>

São Paulo leads in both customer distribution and orders, followed by Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais.
São Paulo also dominates in city-specific distribution. <br>



*Orders peak in August but decline steadily throughout the year, with the lowest in December. <br>

*Orders decrease significantly from Monday to Saturday, with Monday being the busiest and Saturday the least active. <br>

*The majority of ratings are 5 stars, followed by 4 stars. Low ratings (1 or 2 stars) are minimal. <br>


*Credit cards dominate as the preferred payment method, followed by debit cards and vouchers. <br>


*"Bed, Bath & Table" is the leading category, followed by "Health & Beauty" and "Sports & Leisure".
Categories like "Garden Tools" and "Auto" generate the least revenue. <br>


Orders  declined significantly in 2016. <br> <br>


<center><b>Recommendations:</b></center>  <br>


*Focus marketing campaigns on underperforming states like Goiás, Espírito Santo, and others to balance the geographic revenue distribution.
<br>

*Explore promotions and discounts for Friday and Saturday to boost sales on these low-performing days. <br>


*Categories like Garden Tools and Auto could benefit from bundled offers or seasonal promotions to increase revenue.
<br>

*Promote products with consistently 5-star reviews in advertising to build trust and attract more customers. <br>


*Investigate the cause of the steep decline in orders in 2016. Potential reasons could include increased competition, changes in consumer behavior, or economic factors.
<br>

*Since credit cards are the dominant payment method, ensure smooth and secure payment processes to reduce cart abandonment rates.
<br>

*Capitalize on months like August with promotional campaigns to sustain or exceed the peak sales levels. <br>


*Invest in targeted marketing for top-performing categories such as Bed, Bath & Table, 
Health & Beauty, and Sports & Leisure, while identifying additional cross-selling opportunities. <br>
